## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Brazilian Ai engineer and founder passionate about using AI to solve real-world problems.

- 🧪 I specialize in **computer vision**, **edge AI**, and **real-time video analytics**.
- 🏭 I've built CV systems for **industrial automation**, **traffic analytics**, **facial Recognition** and **retail security**.
- 🧑‍💻 I’ve worked with top AI companies like **Pix Force** founded **Vision-Labs** in the year of 2024 to deliver end-to-end AI solutions for businesses.
- 🚀 I'm currently building **ShopGuard AI**, a theft detection platform using computer vision to protect physical retail environments.
- 💡 I'm a builder — I design, train, deploy, and scale AI systems.

## 🚨 Current Project – ShopGuard AI

**ShopGuard AI** is a computer vision platform that detects theft and suspicious behavior in retail stores using real-time video analytics.

- 👁 Detects concealed items, unpaid exits, and staff fraud
- 📲 Sends real-time alerts via dashboard & mobile
- 🛍 Targeting SMBs to enterprise retail chains

> Retailers lose $100B+/year to theft — we're fixing that with real-time AI.
